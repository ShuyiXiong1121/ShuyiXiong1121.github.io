#Final Project - Artist Personal Website

https://shuyixiong1121.github.io

## Overview
As written in the proposal, I aimed to create a personal website that contains my info and my music pieces. In order to improve the UI and styling, I need to introduce CSS and JavaScript into my website. Therefore, I started by creating html, js and css file in my respository.

The website also needs to have my profile picture, my avatar, and my music projects. I created 2 folders, one for image and one for media.

##Process

###1. My Overall Role
I did not write large parts of the code myself, because this is too complicated for my understanding of coding. My main contributions are:
-Coming up with the concept and artistic vision
-providing all my own text content, music files, and photos.
-Understanding small individual pieces of code (what certain lines or rules do).
-Describing clearly what I wanted.
-Making small changes (eg. colors, text, file paths, etc.)

I used Grok like a tool, such as putting my fragmented knowledge together, so my thoughts can be presented.


###2. HTML
I understood basic ideas that I need:
-<img src='images/filename.jpg'> is for showing a photo
-<a href="xxx"> makes a hyperlink
-<p> or headings like <h1>, <h2>, etc. are used to insert texts or title.
-Text is written directly between tags, like <p>I wanna sleep</p>

But I couldn't build the full structure myself.

Therefore, I wrote all my own text content first, told Grok where to insert text, ask it to use the ideas above, and gave it all the guidance.

###3. CSS
I remember fragments of knowledge of CSS:
-<scroll-behavior: smooth>makes nice scrolling effects
-<padding> and <margin>control spacing

But still, I was not able to write full layouts.

I told Grok things like: Adapting the Website to different devices, Font selection, how I wanted the background to look like, etc.

###4. JS
I only learned very basic JS (functions, if/else), so I let Grok handle my JS code...

I wanted some interactive background effect - When scrolling through the page, the background blobs move a little bit, and custom music players, etc.

##Use of AI
I am being very honest, I relied heavily on AI, since it was a impossible task for me to put all the small fragments of knowledge together and make a delicated website like this. 

##Reflection
Even though I relied on Grok for almost all of the actual coding work, I honestly learned more than I expected.

-I finally saw how a real website is built. Before this project, I only knew tiny pieces like <p> for text or border-radius for circles. By directing Grok and studying the code it gave me, I understood HTML handles structure and content, CSS controls the look and responsiveness, and JavaScript makes things interactive.
	
-I got much better at turning artistic ideas into technical instructions. I couldn’t write the entire code myself, but I could clearly describe “soft glowing circles that move slowly on scroll” or “a draggable progress bar with time display and only one song playing at once.” That skill of translating vision into precise words and provide efficient guidance for AI is a very valuable skill.

-I learned to read and safely customize code. Every time Grok sent code, I changed the colors to match my vibe. 

I’m not a full coder yet, but I’m more confident about how websites work. This site is now my artist portfolio that I genuinely like.

Thank you!
